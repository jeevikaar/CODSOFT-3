# CODSOFT-3

RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

This project is part of Task 4 of the CodSoft Internship, focused on building a content-based movie recommendation system using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.

Objective

-To create a simple recommendation engine that suggests similar movies based on their plot descriptions using natural language processing techniques.

Technologies Used

-Python
-Pandas – Data handling
-Scikit-learn – TF-IDF vectorization and similarity computation

How It Works

TF-IDF Vectorizer: Converts movie descriptions into numerical vectors.
Cosine Similarity: Measures similarity between vectors.
Recommendation Function: Returns the top 3 most similar movies to the one provided.

Conclusion
 
This project demonstrates a simple yet effective approach to recommending movies using textual features. 
With a larger dataset and additional metadata (like genre, director, etc.), this system can be expanded into a full-scale recommender engine.
